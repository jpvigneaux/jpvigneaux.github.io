*I taught this course in Fall 2022*

We followed Hatcher's *Algebraic Topology* (Chapter 2 and 3.1) and Bredon's *Geometry and Topology* (mainly Chapter IV and V). 

Homework assignments:

* [Set 1 - Quotient topology, homotopies (review)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/Ma151-2022/Ma_151a___HW_1.pdf)
* Set 2 - Simplicial Homology: Problems 3, 6 and 8 in Section 2.1 of Hatcher's book. 
* [Set 3 - Chain complexes, relative singular homology]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/Ma151-2022/Ma_151a___HW_3.pdf)
* Set 4 - Relative homology: Problems 16, 25 and 27 in Section 2.1 of Hatcher's book.
* Set 5 - Axioms of homology: Problem 3 in Ch. IV Section 6 of Bredon's book; Problems 2, 4, and 8 in Section 2.2 of Hatcher's book. 
* Set 6 - Cellular homology: Exercises 2 and 9 in Bredon's Section 4.10; Exercise 2 in  Bredon's Section 4.12; Exercise 4 in  Bredon's Section 4.13.
*  [Set 7 - Differential forms and De Rham cohomology]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/Ma151-2022/Ma_151a___HW_7.pdf)
*  [Set 8 - Universal Coefficient Theorem]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/Ma151-2022/Ma_151a___HW_8.pdf)
