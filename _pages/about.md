Currently, I am an Olga Taussky and John Todd Instructor in Mathematics at Caltech, mentored by <a href="https://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/">Matilde Marcolli</a>. We co-organize the <a href="https://www.its.caltech.edu/~vigneaux/igps/">Information, Geometry, and Physics Seminar</a>.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences. In 2019, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Paris under the supervision of Daniel Bennequin.

I'm broadly interested in the concept of **information**. My work deals with:

* Characterizations of information measures such as entropy (operational, algebraic, and topological characterizations).
* Dimension theory: relationship between fractal dimensions and information dimension.
* Probability measures with geometric structure, such as rectifiable measures and stratified measures.  
* Magnitude and diversity as categorical generalizations of cardinality and entropy, respectively.
* Combinatorial ("microcanonical") models for generalized entropies.
* Optimal transport and functional inequalities.
