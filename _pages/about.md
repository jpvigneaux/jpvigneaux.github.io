Currently, I am an Olga Taussky and John Todd Instructor in Mathematics at Caltech, mentored by <a href="https://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/">Matilde Marcolli</a>. We co-organize the <a href="https://www.its.caltech.edu/~vigneaux/igps/">Information, Geometry, and Physics Seminar</a>.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences. In 2019, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Paris under the supervision of Daniel Bennequin.

I'm broadly interested in mathematical aspects of **information theory**, particularly in connection with category theory and  geometry (metric geometry, geometric measure theory, ...). 

My published work can be divided in three different areas:
* Characterization of information measures, mainly *information topology*. 
* Information dimension and measures with geometric structure.
* Magnitude and diversity.
 
I'm currently mostly working on explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability of neural networks.

Here's my [academic CV]({site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/Academic-CV-Aug2024.pdf).
