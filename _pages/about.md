Since July 2025, I am a Research Associate in the Department of Linguistics at Northwestern University. I work with [Jennifer Cole](https://sites.northwestern.edu/cole/) and [Khalil Iskarous](https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/khalil-iskarous/) on mathematical models that combine prosody and  meaning in connection with pragmatics. 

I'm also  working on interpretability of transformer-based LLMs, with a particular focus on the geometry of latent spaces and on compositionality. For further details, see the [research section]({{site.baseurl}}/research/). 

From October 2021 to December 2024, I served as an Olga Taussky and John Todd Instructor in Mathematics at Caltech, mentored by <a href="https://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/">Matilde Marcolli</a>. We co-organized the <a href="https://www.its.caltech.edu/~vigneaux/igps/">Information, Geometry, and Physics Seminar</a>.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences. In 2019, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Paris under the supervision of Daniel Bennequin.

My mathematical work deals with **information theory** in connection with category theory and  geometry (metric geometry, geometric measure theory, ...).  My publications in this demain can be divided in three different areas:
* Characterization of information measures, mainly *information topology*. 
* Information dimension and measures with geometric structure.
* Magnitude and diversity.

Here's my [academic CV]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/Academic-CV-Feb2025.pdf).
