I am an Olga Taussky and John Todd Instructor in Mathematics at Caltech, mentored by Matilde Marcolli. We co-organize the <a href=>Information, Geometry, and Physics Seminar</a>.

I'm broadly interested in the concept of **information**. My recent work focuses on:
* Information Topology, a novel approach by  Baudot and Bennequin that identifies Shannon entropy and other information functions as homological (topological) invariants attached to certain spaces of observables. 
* Rectifiable and stratified measures: asymptotic concentration of i.i.d. realizations, links between geometric measure theory and the information dimension introduced by Renyi.
* Magnitude and diversity, introduced by Leinster and his collaborators, as a categorical generalization of cardinality and entropy, respectively.
* Combinatorial "microcanonical" models for generalized entropies.
