  abstract={This thesis extends in several directions the cohomological study of information theory pioneered by Baudot and Bennequin. We introduce a topos-theoretical notion of statistical space and then study several cohomological invariants. Information functions and related objects appear as distinguished cohomology classes; the corresponding cocycle equations encode recursive properties of these functions. Information has thus topological meaning and topology serves as a unifying framework. 

Part I discusses the geometrical foundations of the theory. Information structures are introduced as categories that encode  the relations of refinement between different statistical observables. We study products and coproducts of information structures, as well as their representation by measurable functions or hermitian operators. Every information structure gives rise to a ringed site; we discuss in detail the definition of \emph{information cohomology} using the homological tools developed by Artin, Grothendieck, Verdier and their collaborators. 

Part II studies the cohomology of discrete random variables. Information functions---Shannon entropy, Tsallis $\alpha$-entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence---appear as $1$-cocycles for appropriate modules of probabilistic coefficients (functions of probability laws). In the combinatorial case (functions of histograms), the only  $0$-cocycle is the exponential function, and the $1$-cocycles are generalized multinomial coefficients (Fontené-Ward). There is an asymptotic relation between the combinatorial and probabilistic cocycles. 

Part III studies in detail the $q$-multinomial coefficients, showing that their growth rate is connected to Tsallis 2-entropy (quadratic entropy). When $q$ is a prime power, these $q$-multinomial coefficients count flags of finite vector spaces with prescribed length and dimensions. We obtain a combinatorial explanation for the nonadditivity of the quadratic entropy and a frequentist justification for the maximum entropy principle with Tsallis statistics. We introduce a discrete-time stochastic process associated to the $q$-binomial probability distribution that generates finite vector spaces (flags of length 2). The concentration of measure on certain \emph{typical subspaces} allows us to extend  Shannon's theory to this setting. 

Part IV discusses the generalization of information cohomology to continuous random variables. We study the functoriality properties of conditioning (seen as disintegration) and its compatibility with marginalization. The cohomological computations are restricted to the real valued, gaussian case. When coordinates are fixed, the $1$-cocycles are the differential entropy as well as generalized moments.  When computations are done in a  coordinate-free manner, with the so-called  \emph{grassmannian categories}, we recover as the only degree-one cohomology classes the entropy and the dimension. This constitutes a novel algebraic characterization of differential entropy. },

Combined with the entropic chain rule for disintegrations (Vigneaux, 2021), they account for some properties of the entropy of rectifiable measures with respect to the Hausdorff measure first studied by (Koliander et al., 2016). Then we present some recent work on stratified measures, which are convex combinations of rectifiable measures. These generalize discrete-continuous mixtures and may have a singular continuous part. Their entropy obeys a chain rule, whose ``conditional term'' is an average of the entropies of the rectifiable measures involved. We state an asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) for stratified measures that shows concentration on strata of a few ``typical dimensions'' and that links the conditional term of the chain rule to the volume growth of typical sequences in each stratum.",

The entropy becomes the logarithm of the cardinality of the set when the uniform probability is used. Leinster introduced a notion of Euler characteristic for certain finite categories, also known as magnitude, that can be seen as a categorical generalization of cardinality. This paper aims to connect the two ideas by considering the extension of Shannon entropy to finite categories endowed with probability, in such a way that the magnitude is recovered when a certain choice of "uniform" probability is made.},

    abstract={We introduce an original notion of extra-fine sheaf on a topological space, and a variant (hyper-extra-fine) for which Čech cohomology in strictly positive degree vanishes. We provide a characterization of such sheaves when the topological space is a partially ordered set (poset) equipped with the Alexandrov topology. Then we further specialize our results to some sheaves of vector spaces and injective maps, where extra-fineness is (essentially) equivalent to the decomposition of the sheaf into a direct sum of subfunctors, known as interaction decomposition, and can be expressed by a sum-intersection condition. We use these results to compute the dimension of the space of global sections when the presheaves are freely generated over a functor of sets, generalizing classical counting formulae for the number of solutions of the linearized marginal problem (Kellerer and Matúš). We finish with a comparison theorem between the Čech cohomology associated to a covering and the topos cohomology of the poset with coefficients in the presheaf, which is also the cohomology of a cosimplicial local system over the nerve of the poset. For that, we give a detailed treatment of cosimplicial local systems on simplicial sets. The appendixes present presheaves, sheaves and Čech cohomology, and their application to the marginal problem.},

In particular, the $q$-binomial coefficients count vector subspaces of given dimension. We obtain in this way a combinatorial explanation for the nonadditivity of the quadratic entropy, which arises from a recursive counting of flags. We show that statistical systems whose configurations are described by flags provide a frequentist justification for the maximum entropy principle with Tsallis statistics.

The size of the typical set is quantified by the quadratic entropy. We discuss the applications to Shannon theory, particularly to source coding, when messages correspond to vector spaces.},

   abstract={We define \emph{stratified measures} on Euclidean space as convex combinations of rectifiable measures. They are possibly singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure and generalize discrete-continuous mixtures. A stratified measure $\rho$ can thus be represented as $\sum_{i=1}^k q_i \rho_i$, where $(q_1,..,q_k)$ is a probability vector and each $\rho_i$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the $m_i$-Hausdorff measure $\mu_i$ on a $m_i$-rectifiable set $E_i$ (e.g. a smooth $m_i$-manifold if $m_i>0$ or a countable set if $m_i=0$).
We introduce a set of strongly typical realizations of $\rho^{\otimes n}$ that occur with high probability; they are supported on a finite union of strata $E_{i_1}\times \cdots \times E_{i_n}$ whose dimensions ``per factor'' concentrate around the \emph{mean dimension} $\sum_{i=1}^k q_i m_i$. For each $n$, an appropriate sum of Hausdorff measures on the different strata gives a notion of reference ``volume''; the exponential growth rate of the typical set's volume is quantified by Csiszar's \emph{generalized entropy} of $\rho$  with respect to $\mu=\sum_{i=1}^k \mu_i$. This entropy satisfies a chain rule; the conditional term is related to the volume growth of the typical realizations in each stratum. Under suitable hypotheses, our notion of mean dimension coincides with R\'enyi's information dimension when applied to stratified measures, but the generalized entropy used here differs from R\'enyi's dimensional entropy. },

We extend Baudot and Bennequin's definition of information cohomology to this setting, as a derived functor in the category of modules over the structure ring, and show explicitly that the bar construction gives a projective resolution in that category, recovering in this way the cochain complexes previously considered in the literature. Finally, we study the particular case of a one-parameter family of coefficients made of functions of probability distributions. The only 1-cocycles are Shannon entropy or Tsallis $\alpha$-entropy, depending on the value of the parameter.},

Depending on the coefficients, the 1-cocycles can be information measures (Shannon entropy, Tsallis $\alpha$-entropy) or generalized (Fontené-Ward) multinomial coefficients. In each case the 1-cocycle condition encodes a system of functional equations. We obtain in particular a combinatorial analogue of the “fundamental equation of information theory”: a simple functional equation that uniquely characterizes the generalized binomial coefficients.

It is defined using the coarse incidence algebra of rational-valued functions on the given finite category, and a distinguished element in this algebra: the Dirichlet zeta function. The incidence algebra may be identified with the algebra of $n\times n$ matrices over the rational numbers, where $n$ is the cardinality of the underlying object set. The Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of a matrix is a generalization of the inverse; it exists and is unique for any given matrix over the complex numbers. In this article, we derive a new method for calculating the magnitude of a finite category, using the pseudoinverse of the matrix that corresponds to the zeta function. The magnitude equals the sum of the entries of this pseudoinverse.},

Our result contains, as particular cases, previous theorems by Hall (for posets) and Leinster (for skeletal categories whose idempotents are identities). A byproduct is a novel expression for the magnitude of a metric space as sum over self-avoiding paths with finitely many terms. By means of Berg's formula, our main constructions can be extended to Moore-Penrose pseudoinverses, yielding an analogous combinatorial interpretation of M\"obius pseudoinversion and, consequently, of the magnitude of an arbitrary finite category.},
