In deriving MASS Learning, we also introduce Conserved Differential Information (CDI), an information-theoretic quantity that {—} unlike standard mutual information {—} can be usefully applied to deterministically-dependent continuous random variables like the input and output of a deep network. In a series of experiments, we show that deep networks trained with MASS Learning achieve competitive performance on supervised learning, regularization, and uncertainty quantification benchmarks.},
